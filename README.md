Lightweight WordPress container with OpenLiteSpeed 1.5.10 & PHP 7.3 based on Ubuntu 18.04 Linux.

WordPress version will install: Latest

### Prerequisites
1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
3. Clone this repository or copy the files from this repository into a new folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/litespeedtech/ols-docker-env.git
```

## Configuration
Edit the `.env` file to change the WordPress Domain, user and password, default MySQL root and wordpress password .

## Installation
Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:
```
docker-compose up
```
There's an existing `sites` folder next to your docker-compose.yml file.

* `sites` â€“ the location of your WordPress application
* `sites/localhost/logs/` - the location of your access log

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the WordPress installation with the configured domain in the browser address. By default it is http://127.0.0.1.

## Usage

You can start the containers with up or start methods:
```
docker-compose up
